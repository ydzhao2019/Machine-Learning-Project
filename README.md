# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine Learning and Financial Application Project

Employed Machine Learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes and SVM, as well as Ensemble models such as Bagging, Boosting and Stacking, to predict Market Movement at time t+1 using available financial data at time t, achieved precision 0.67 and recall 0.62

1. DataCleansing: get_data.py (most data is obtained from investing.com and Yahoo Finance)

2. FeatureEngineering: get_feature.py (create new features using raw data)

3. RawFeatureInput: select_feature.py (since we had too many features, we had to extract most important ones form trader's perspective)

4. ModelTraining: model_train_test.py (main part--model train and test)
